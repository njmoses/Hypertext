				<br>
				
				Beams of moonlight shine through the windowsill onto a bed half covered with unmade maroon cotton sheets.  Suddenly, the door opens and light floods the room.  <a href="hyper_text_p5.html">In walks Nathan</a>, a 22-year-old college senior.  He is clearly shitfaced as he sits on the edge of his bed and struggles to take his shoes off.
				<br>
				NATHAN
				<br>
				<a href="hyper_text_p7.html">Fucking piece of shit shoe laces.</a>
				<br>
				Eventually, he pulls both shoes off and throws them towards his hamper.  Both shoes land in the trash bin next to the hamper.  Nathan doesn’t notice.  Suddenly he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a phone, which possesses human like features.
