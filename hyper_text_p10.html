				<br>
Phoney wakes up.  A Beam of light shines directly onto his shattered face.  He is close to death but sees blurred movements and hears muffled noises.  Finally, his eyes adjust.  Nathan paces around his room holding a small white box.  He opens the box and pulls out a whimpering new born Iphone.

				<br>
